Overview
----------
- **Languages**: C++

This program is a C++ implementation of the Boggle word game.  The GUI was provided and I implemented the back-end logic which included: instantiating a board instance, loading and constructing the lexicon, determining if a word was valid based on the lexicon, and determining all possible valid words given any board instance.
